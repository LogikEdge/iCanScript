# Packages and Navigation

**Notice:** This article builds upon the visual script created in the [_Using the Library_][UsingTheLibrary] article.

The _Package_ node is one of the premium features of iCanScript.  The _Package_ node type:

- enables segregation and multi-level nesting of the visual script;
- supports the divid and conquer approach to writing visual scripts;
- serves as the basis for user defined visual script _prefab_ libraries.

## Wrapping Existing Nodes in a Package

To embed the existing visual script inside a _Package_ node:

1. Use the multi-select feature of iCanScript to select all nodes inside the _Update_ node;
    - **Crtl-Click** for Windows users;
    - **Cmd-Click** for OSX users.
2. Right-click (or two finger click for OSX) to show multi-select contextual menu;
3. Select "_**+ Wrap Multi-Selection in Package**_".
