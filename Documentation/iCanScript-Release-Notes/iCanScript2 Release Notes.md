## iCanScript v2.0.25 ##

_July 23, 2015_

V2.0.25 is a bug fix release.

**<span style="color: red">\[WARNING\]:</span>**  **EXAMPLES FILES prior to v2.0.24:**

Each example created prior to V2.0.24 uses a seperate namespace but a common code generation folder for all of the examples.  With packages, the namespaces and code generation folders should be seperate.  Therefore, these examples must be adapted to work with V2.0.24.

### List of Changes

- **<span style="color: red">\[FIXED\] </span>** Package folder path not properly set on Windows platform.
- **<span style="color: red">\[FIXED\] </span>** Port editor not properly displayed when port value is _NULL_.

## iCanScript v2.0.24 ##

_July 22, 2015_

V2.0.24 introduces the iCanScript packages!

A package allows to configure common traits for a group of visual scripts.  Packages can be independent or nested.
The package controls the following visual script traits:

- engine & editor namespaces;
- engine & editor code generation folders;
- engine & editor visual script folders (future use).
