\f0\fs36 \cf0 Release 0.9.1 (Beta #7) of iCanScript has a fully redesign UI engine and visual script internal data representation. It will serve as the bases for all future product releases and assures forward product compatibility (missing in the previous releases). You will find that the flexibility of the visual editor is enhanced including manual repositioning of the connector ports on the appropriate node edges and that the nodes will attempt to retain the user position even when involved in collisions from unfolding / folding surrounding nodes.\
\
Since this version will be forward compatible, you may start using it for long term projects.\
\
Enjoy !!!}
