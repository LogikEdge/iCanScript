\f0\fs28 \cf0 - **Undo / Redo:** Unity version 4.3.2f1 has a nasty bug with its Undo feature.  The operations that are affected by this bug are those that involves mouse drag (in fact any operations that generates multiple internal UI events).  Beware that we are following the evolution of this bug and will make any necessary adjustments once Unity has corrected the issue.\
- **Performance Glitches:** Having the _Transform_ displayed in the inspector when playing a visual script can cause some performance glitches.  Please fold the _Transform_ if you find that the execution is jerky.}
