\f0\fs28 \cf0 The manual itself has been split into five primary sections and an appendix. The first section introduces iCanScript\'92s terminology and interface and gives a quick tour for those who want to start writing as soon as possible. It is highly recommended that you also go through the Quick Tour (chapter 6) to get the most out of iCanScript and eliminate confusion over some of its unique features.}
