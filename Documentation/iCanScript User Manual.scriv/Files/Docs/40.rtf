\f0\fs28 \cf0 iCanScript was created to help and improve the design process for creating software.  It is meant to extend the standard text editor for writing Unity scripts.  It offers a visual workflow to build, review, and publish programming logic without removing the ability to write low-level logic using standard toolsets.\
iCanScript roots its philosophy in that at one point, the software to be created uses concepts that are better expressed in terms of high-level building blocks including multi-level state charts.\
Number crushing is best expressed using low-level software and textual source code editors, high-level concepts are better expressed using visual design elements.  Often, corporations include a formal or informal development process to discuss and publish the high-level concepts pertaining the software product to be developed.   In all cases, these high-level concepts are expressed using diagrams as it is the simplest and most direct way of building and iterating on those fundamental aspects of the product.\
