Our goal in creating iCanScript is to simplify and accelerate scripting within Unity's development environment. iCanScript offers a visual alternative to traditional textual scripts enabling greater accessibility for both programmers and non-programmers.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that depicting the scripts allows for a larger community of talents to interact with the high-level logic that drive your games.  It simplifies the understanding of the overall structure to all individuals in your production.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Nodes, Ports, and Bindings</strong><br/>A good understanding of the fundamental building blocks of a visual script is necessary to effectively use iCanScript.<br/>
<br/>
A visual script includes three (3) types of component being:<br/>
<br/>
- **Nodes**;<br/>
- **Ports**; and ...<br/>
- **Bindings.**<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$Figure=building-blocks>.  Visual Script Building Blocks.]<br/>
<br/>
The **node** is the primary ingredient of visual scripts.  Its main purpose is to encapsulate various type of behaviours such as:<br/>
<br/>
- variables & functions;<br/>
- algorithms;<br/>
- states and state charts; and<br/>
- ...</p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Node Anatomy</strong><br/>- node role<br/>
- node types<br/>
- common attributes<br/>
- visual editor view & controls<br/>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Specialized Nodes</strong><br/>The nodes come in various types or specialization.  For example, their is a specialization that represents _Variables_, another that represents _Functions_ and yet another for _Message Handlers_.  <br/>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Adding a Visual Script</strong><br/>To use iCanScript, you first need to install a visual scripts on one of your game objects.  To illustrate this process, we will add a visual script to a sphere that will later be used as a trigger zone. <br/>
<br/>
To do so, you must:<br/>
<br/>
1. Select a game object to contain the visual script;<br/>
2. Create a visual script using the menu item: `iCanScript->Create Visual Script`. <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Objective</strong><br/>In this section, we examine the core constructs of iCanScript with the help of a small example.  To that end, we shall first establish the working parameters of our example by creating a storyline and setting up the scene before implementing the visual scripts.<br/>
<br/>
The following is a summary of the steps to build our first example:<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a [storyline][] to define the working parameters for our example;<br/>
2. Identify and define the [actors][Our Actors] for our story;<br/>
3. Build a scene in Unity pop...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Storyline</strong><br/>If you are like me, you prefer learning the workings of a tool in the context of a small example.  Like all good game designers, I like to give a soul to my project using a storyline.  We can then extract working scenarios to direct the creation of our visual scripts.<br/>
<br/>
Here goes the story:<br/>
<br/>
>  In the land of Emptiness lives Mr Cube.  Mr Cube has a busy life roaming around on an invisible 2D plane.  Since Mr Cube is a close relative of Mr Fly, he is attracted to Ms Light that also lives in the la...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Our Actors</strong><br/>Before creating visual scripts, we first need to build a scene in Unity and populate it with actors. Based on the storyline, the actors are (the camera has been purposely omitted):<br/>
- **Mr. Cube** (I'll let you guess the shape to use);<br/>
- **Ms. Light** (a directional light);<br/>
- **Near Trigger Zone** to turn off _Ms. Light_ (a sphere will do fine);<br/>
- **Far Trigger Zone** to turn on _Ms. Light_ (again a sphere will do fine).<br/>
The main characteristics of the actors are:<br/>
- All actors live on a 2D plane ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Creating the Unity Project</strong><br/>We are now ready to build our scene in Unity.  First, we need a fresh new Unity project with an installed version of iCanScript.  For the purpose of this tutorial, the project will be named "Houpi Youpi" (I don't know how to call it! So please bear with me...).<br/>
<br/>
Open Unity and select the `File->New Project...` menu item as shown in the image below:<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=unity-new-project>. Create a new Unity project.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next you will be asked for a project name and prompted to install standard Unity pack...</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Adding Actors to the Scene</strong><br/>Ok, we are ready to bring our actors into the scene.  For each new project, Unity creates a default scene with the main camera object.  You will add the actors to the default scene using the `GameObject->...` menu.<br/>
</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ms Light</strong><br/>Let's start by adding _Ms Light_.  Select the `GameObject->Create Other->Directional Light` menu item and, _swoosh ... Ms Light_ appears.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=adding-mrs-light>. Adding Ms Light to the scene.]<br/>
<br/>
Double click on the _"Directional light"_ label in the hierarchy panel to rename it to _"Ms Light"_.  Because _Ms Light_ is a directional light, she lights the scene equally regardless of her position.  For consistency shake with our story, I suggest you position her at (0,0,0) as show in Figure <...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Near & Far Trigger Zones</strong><br/>The two trigger zones are spheric in shape and are create with the `GameObject->Create Other->Sphere` menu.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=adding-trigger-zones>. Adding Trigger Zones to the Scene.]<br/>
<br/>
After you have created both _trigger zones_, you need to configure them as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1. Name one of them _"Near Trigger Zone"_ and the other _"Far Trigger Zone"_;<br/>
2. As for _Ms Light_, position both trigger zones at (0,0,0);<br/>
3. Now resize the _"Near Trigger Zone"_ to 2 meters and the _"Far Trigger Zone"_ to 3 meters b...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Mr Cube</strong><br/>We are now ready for our final actor: _Mr Cube_.  Use the `GameObject->Create Other->Cube` menu item to add _Mr Cube_ to the scene.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=adding-mr-cube>. Adding Mr Cube to the scene.]<br/>
<br/>
Once more, you need to set the initial parameters of the new actor.  _Mr Cube_ must be configured as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1. Rename the cube object to _"Mr Cube"_ (sexy!);<br/>
2. Relocate _Mr Cube_ outside both trigger zones at position (5,0,0);<br/>
3. For _Mr Cube_ to collide with the trigger zones, it must have a _Rigid Bo...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Hiding the Trigger Zones</strong><br/>All of our actors are now included in the scene.  However, we still need to make one last adjustment: hide the trigger zones.<br/>
<br/>
The trigger zones are the _"magic"_ that makes actors change behaviour and everyone knows that _"magic"_ must be invisible.  So, let's hide those spheres for no one to see.  To hide the trigger zones, you need to disable the _Mesh Renderer_  as depicted in the below figure.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>

</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Opening the iCanScript Editors</strong><br/><br/>
You are almost ready to create your first visual script.  Before you do so, you need to open the following four iCanScript editors:<br/>
<br/>
- Visual Editor;<br/>
- Library Tree;<br/>
- Hierarchy Tree and;<br/>
- Instance Wizard.<br/>
<br/>
All of the editors can be opened for the `Window->iCanScript->...` menu item.  The _Visual Editor_ requires a significant screen area so I propose that you combine it with the _Scene_ or _Game_ window.  All of the other editors are narrow and tall and may be combine with the Unity _Project_...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Moving Mr Cube (step 1)</strong><br/>Finally, you are ready to write your first visual script.  _Mr Cube_ movement is ratter complex and shall be implement in phases.  In this section, you will create a visual script to move _Mr Cube_ at a consistent speed regardless of the performance of the computer or game platform running the script.<br/>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Installing a Visual Script on _Mr Cube_</strong><br/>The first step is to install a visual script on _Mr Cube_.  This is accomplished by:<br/>
<br/>
1. Selecting _Mr Cube_ in the Hierarchy and;<br/>
2. Clicking on the menu item `Component->iCanScript->Visual Script`.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>

A visual script is now installed on _Mr Cube_ and ready to receive Unity messages.  To edit the visual script, you must select _Mr Cube_ (if not already done) and activate the _Visual Editor_ by clicking on ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Installing the _Update_ Message Handler</strong><br/><br/>
Before displaying a new frame, Unity sends an _Update_ message to each game object in the scene asking them to prepare for the upcoming frame.  This _Update_ message is ideal to trigger the execution of the visual script to move _Mr Cube_.  It gives you the chance to recompute _Mr Cube_ position immediately before the scene is displayed.<br/>
<br/>
Your next step is to install the _Update_ message handler node whom will serve as the parent trigger for your visual script.  The creation of the _Update_ mes...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Visual Script Overview</strong><br/><br/>
_Mr Cube_ visual script will evolve to become somewhat involved as you increase its functionality.  To avoid complex and overblown graphs, you should consider structuring the visual script from its inception.<br/>
<br/>
The following diagram depicts the high-level design of the visual script you will create for Mr Cube:<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Creating the _"Move Mr Cube Package"_</strong><br/>Let's create a package to encapsulate the basic movement functionality of _Mr Cube_.  This is achieved by:<br/>
<br/>
- Right clicking on the _Update_ node to display the context sensitive menu and;<br/>
- Selecting the `+ Package` menu item.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=creating-package-in-update>. Creating the _"Move Mr Cube"_ Package.]<br/>

iCanScript adds a package node under the _Update_ message handler.  By default, the package is yellow and named _":Package"_.  A name that better describes the purpose of the package would ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Adding _Mr Cube_ to the Visual Script</strong><br/><br/>
It's now time to put beef into your hamburger!  The first ingredient you need is _Mr Cube_.  He can be brought into the visual script by dragging him from Unity's Hierarchy panel into the _Move Mr Cube_ package (see figure <$rfigure=drag-and-drop-mr-cube>).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=drag-and-drop-mr-cube>. Adding Mr Cube to the _Move Mr Cube_ package.]<br/>

The new _Mr Cube_ node is coloured orange indicating that it is an instance of an entity.  Factually, _Mr Cube_ is an instance of a _Game Object_: a comple...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Exposing the _Transform_ of _Mr Cube_</strong><br/>In Unity, a game object and its components form a group of inter-related objects.  The game object maintains a list of all of its components and each component keeps a reference back to the game object as depicted in figure <$rfigure=game-object-composition>.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=game-object-composition>. Unity _Game Object_ and associated _Components_.]<br/>
<br/>
To gain access to a component of the game object, you first need to extract it as a separate instance node.  You can then interact with the component ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Adding the _Translation_ operation to the _Transform_ node</strong><br/><br/>
Now that you have access to the _Transform_ instance node, you can select it and browse its variables and operations using the _Instance Wizard_ (figure <$rfigure=add-mr-cube-translation>).<br/>
<br/>
If you browse the _Operations_ section, you will find that the _Transform_ node includes several _Translate(...)_ operations that can be used to move _Mr Cube_.  We are interested in the _Translate_ operation that utilizes a _Vector3_ type for the displacement.<br/>
<br/>
To add the _Translate_ operation to your visu...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Moving with Consistent Velocity</strong><br/>In this section we discuss the difficulty that we have with the displacement and the variable frame rate. We also provide a solution to resolve the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Controlling Speed and Direction Separately</strong><br/>Referencing back to the [overview of the visual script][Visual Script Overview] depicted in figure <$rfigure=mr-cube-script-overview>, you will notice that the _Move Mr Cube_ package receives its input values from the _Adjust Direction_ & _Adjust Speed_ packages (you will build these packages later on).  This means that separate controls for direction and speed are required.<br/>
<br/>
Your next task is to extend your visual script to:<br/>
<br/>
- accept two (2) inputs: a _direction_ and a _speed_ value;<br/>
- compute...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Publishing the Interface</strong><br/><br/>
Now you have completed the functionality of the _Move Mr Cube_ package.  The last step is to publish the _speed_ and _direction_ ports so that they can be accessed from outside the _Move Mr Cube_ package.  This is easily done by dragging them on the left edge of the _Move Mr Cube_ package.  The final build of the _Move Mr Cube_ package can be seen in figure <$rfigure=publish-speed-and-direction>.<br/>
<br/>
#<br/>
[<$figure=publish-speed-and-direction>. Publish speed and direction ports.]</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Running the _Move Mr Cube_ Visual Script</strong><br/><br/>
<br/>
I bet your fingers are twitching to give your new script a go.<br/>
<br/>
Before you do so, you need to configure initial values for the _speed_ and _direction_ ports.  The initial values are configured using the _Inspector_.<br/>
<br/>
Make certain that the _Mr Cube_ game object is selected and open the _Inspector_.  You will see that a _visual script component_ is installed on _Mr Cube_.  Unfold the _visual script component_ and you will see that it contains two sections:<br/>
<br/>
- a _**Selected Object**_ section and;...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Accessing Runtime Information</strong><br/><br/>
Let's take this opportunity to discuss some of the basic debugging features of iCanScript.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Extending iCanScript</strong><br/>From its inception, iCanScript was designed to be extendable with the addition of user defined nodes. Once installed, the user defined nodes are accessible from the [Library Tree].<br/>
<br/>
Extending the iCanScript library is realized by:<br/>
<br/>
1. [Tagging your Source Code]; <br/>
2. [Importing Public Members]; <br/>
3. [Adding Message Handlers]. <br/>

The following picture illustrates how the iCanScript library gets populated and used.  You are given three access points (purple) to include your own packages and nodes ins...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tagging your Source Code</strong><br/>iCanScript includes several .NET attributes to control which part of your source code is to be included in the iCanScript library. These attributes enables fine control over which fields, properties and functions become visible to the iCanScript user.<br/>
<br/>
iCanScript scans the .NET assemblies to populate its library with public classes tagged with the *iCS_Class* attribute.  The assembly scan is performed after every recompile of the Unity scripts.<br/>

The following table depicts the mapping between C#...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Importing Public Members</strong><br/>iCanScript supports invoking a custom installer to add all public fields, properties and functions of an object definition into the iCanScript library.<br/>
<br/>
This method of populating the iCanScript library is ideal if:<br/>
<br/>
-  you are not in control of the source code (i.e. using a vendor library) or;<br/>
-  you want to add all public fields, properties and functions of your classes without tagging your source code with iCanScript custom attributes.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Adding Message Handlers</strong><br/><br/>
The [Tagging your Source Code] and [Importing Public Members] installing mechanism extract existing functionality from the object definition to publish into the iCanScript library.  However, they do not provide for defining message handlers for the Unity framework.  This is because the Unity messages are dynamically created at runtime and are therefore not visible in the object definitions.<br/>
<br/>
The message handlers nodes have the following characteristics:<br/>
