\f0\fs26 \cf0 If you are like me, you prefer learning the workings of a tool in the context of a small example.  Like all good game designers, I like to give a soul to my project using a storyline.  We can then extract working scenarios to direct the creation of our visual scripts.\
\
Here goes the story:\
\
>  
\f1\i In the land of Emptiness lives Mr Cube.  Mr Cube has a busy life roaming around on an invisible 2D plane.  Since Mr Cube is a close relative of Mr Fly, he is attracted to Ms Light that also lives in the land of Emptiness. Little does Mr Cube know is that Ms Light is shy and she get "turned off" if anyone comes to close to her.  When in the dark, Mr Cube panics and runs around in all directions.  Luckily for Mr Cube, Ms Light gets "turned on" when Mr Cube is far enough from her.\
