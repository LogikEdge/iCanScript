\f0\fs26 \cf0 iCanScript is a package for creating and modifying visual scripts for the Unity game platform.  It is constructed with two (2) subsystems:\
\
Editor subsystem\
: Responsible for creating visual scripts.\
\
Engine subsystem\
: Responsible for running visual scripts.\
\
\
### The Editor Subsystem\
\
As you may have guessed, the *Editor subsystem* includes:\
\
* the five (5) editors;\
* the menu items and;\
* the node library database.\
\
The editors and menu items are employed to create and modify the visual scripts.  These editors are:\
\
* the ***Preferences Panel***;\
* the ***Library Tree***;\
* the ***Visual Editor***;\
* the ***Hierarchy Tree*** and;\
* the ***Instance Wizard***.\
\
Refer to the [Editors] and [Menus] section for additional details.\
\
### The Engine Subsystem\
\
The *engine subsystem* includes all of the "stuff" required to run a visual script.  That is:\
	* the visual script persistent storage;\
	* the runtime code of each node;\
	* the node compiler and;\
	* the visual script runtime executive.\
\
Since the *Engine subsystem* is responsible for running the visual script, it most be distributed with your product.  No effort on your part is needed since the runtime portion of iCanScript is automatically included when you build for a target platform.\
\
You don't need to worry about license distribution since the iCanScript engine is royalty free as long as you have bought the iCanScript product for each of your development seat.\
