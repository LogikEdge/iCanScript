# Node Anatomy #

The _node_ is by far the most elaborate component of visual scripts.  It plays a key role in the structure, execution, and layout of the visual script.

All nodes in iCanScript share a common set of attributes:

- **Name:** A character string representation of the node;
- **Type:** Identifies the node specialization.
- **Tree-like Hierarchical Structure:**
	- A parent node;
	- Zero or more child components:
		- _Ports_;
		- _Child Nodes_ (nested Visual Script).
- **Graphical Representation:** (see figure 2
	- Position within the parent node;
	- Display State:
		- _Unfolded_;
		- _Folded_; or
		- _Iconized_.

The following image depicts an unfolded node as seen in the _Visual Editor_:

The following image depicts the same unfolded node as seen in the _Tree View_:

1. **Node Name:**  User configurable name for the node.  The name is editable in the inspector or the hierarchy tree.  The programmatic function / type name is used by default.
2. **Iconize Control:** Clicking this pictogram causes the node to take its iconic representation.
3. **Fold/Unfold Control:**  Clicking this pictogram toggles the node between its folded and unfolded representation.  The fold/unfold control is available only for those node types that can contain nested visual scripts. (see [Node Types] for details).
4. **Node Ports:**  Ports are positioned on any of the four node edges.
	- _Port Name_ is displayed inside the node;
	- _Port Value_ is display outside the node.  
5. **Nested Visual Script:** The central area of the node is used to manage the nested child nodes.  The child node container is only visible when the node is unfolded.  See section [Node Types] for details on which node types support nested children.
