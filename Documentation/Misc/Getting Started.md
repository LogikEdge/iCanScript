iCanScript's user interface is made up five editors. These editors can be opened from the Unity window menu item.

### Visual Editor
The visual editor is the core editor from which you will design your visual scripts. It is the central window in you will use throughout the usage of iCanScript.

### Library Tree
The library panel is where you will find many of the components you will add to your visual script. iCanScript includes several library items from Unity scripting library as well as some of the basic .NET components. As a user you will be able to populate the library with your own notes which can be created using standard text editors.

### Hierarchy Tree
The hierarchy panel is a tree view of your visual script. It allows you to browse your visual script using a parent-child relationship. You can also use the hierarchy panel to rename nodes and ports contained in your visual scripts.

### Instance Wizard
The instance wizard editor is used to add functionality to an instance of an object in your scene. It provides an object oriented concept which can be used within your visual scripts.
